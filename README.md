# Joel A Bruce

## Current Research
### AI Rust Library
Currently, I am working on a Rust library that is performant for AI work. It focuses on simply creating layers, specifying some hyper-parameters, and helps in training and inference use. This is my most active repository.

### Solver and SolverJs
Projects I work on when new insights into combinatorics and optimizations hit me. One is written in C#, and the Node.js version was a starting point for using Docker.
